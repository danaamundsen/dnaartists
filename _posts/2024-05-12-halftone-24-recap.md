Hi! Dana here, checking in to recap Halftone Zine Fest 2024. This was a great local event for kentuckians to share their work and meet other artists and zinesters. Compared to last yeasr Halftone Zine Fest, the atmosphere was more relaxed and intimate.

We made the smaller space work and fit our display onto a half table for the event. Dana got to chat with some old Pals who remembered DnA from last years Halftone event, and also meet some new Pals!

We were happy to be able to attend this event for the second year in a row and look forward to seeing the event continue to grow, and to meet more people in the Kentucky zine community!
