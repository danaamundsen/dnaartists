While we're in Detroit we're giong to have freebies for anyone who visits the table! We'll be bringing our DnA 2023 Manifesting Micro Zines, which you can peep <a href="https://www.dnaartists.net/publications/23-micro-dna.html">here</a>. We reflected on what we’re looking forward to in 2023, and made our little manifesting booklets so that we don’t lose sight of what’s important this year. Keep an eye on our <a href="https://www.dnaartists.net/events/">event page</a> for all the fests we’ll be at to grab your copies!
