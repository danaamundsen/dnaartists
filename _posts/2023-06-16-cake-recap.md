Alex here, sharing my final fest recap of the summer: [Chicago Alternative Comic Expo](https://www.cakechicago.com/) (better known as **CAKE**)

This fest came fast on the heels of CZF, and so I got to see even more pals for a second or third time between Halftone, CZF, and CAKE - which was so exciting! But Saturday I attended workshops and skipped the vendor floor.

**DAY 1**
I kicked things off at the workshop: *Make Your Own 6 Page Comic with Joy San*. Joy was a great instructor and shared a lot of really cool aspects of her process making mini comics - you should immediately [check out her work](https://www.joysan.ca/) (she posts a lot of horror comics for free on her site!) After that I stuck around for another amazing Beth Hetland workshop, but this time she teamed up with Jeff Zwirek for *Self-Publishing and Print Comics*. I got to try a new bookform I hadn't used before thanks to Beth, and learned a lot about self-publishing and printing options from Jeff who leads [Print Ninja](https://printninja.com/) here in IL. I left crazy inspired by what I could do beyond my typical mini-zines, saddle-stitched zines, and bespoke artists' books. There are so many options for self-publishers like me! After that I went down to my old haunt, Thorndale beach, and capitalized this creative energy to do some work on my concept for Hallowzine. That wrapped up day one for me, but day two had more in store!

**DAY 2**
I returned to the Broadway Armory just in time for *Pathways to Success in Modern Publishing*, a panel with [Bulgilhan Press](https://bulgilhanpress.com/), [Pyrite Press](http://www.pyritepress.com/), and [Lucky Pocket Press](https://www.luckypocketpress.com/). It was so inspiring to hear the panelists talk about their love of comics and small-press-publishing and really made it all feel less intimidating. Along with great practical business advice, I left feeling more empowered to reach out to small presses and generally join the alternative comics community.

After that...it was time for the vendor floor. And what a floor it was! Once again it was almost overwhelming how many very cool folks were selling very cool things - and this time it was my ultimate kryptonite: comics. After the blow my wallet took at CZF my haul isn't as grand, but it is mighty and full of fond memories since much of it was traded for with some of my stickers. Everyone was so nice, but just like last time I've taken on the difficult task of highlighting only five - so make sure you validate my emotional turmoil and check them out!

+ [Kels Choo](http://kelschoo.com/) - Beth introduced me to Kels and we had a really fun time chatting about her work and sticker vendor choices, haha. Along with great conversation, she had great work! I'm obsessed with the Lunch Bunch stickers we traded and will definitely be following her IG closely for new work.
+ [Wenting Li](https://www.wentingli.com/) - I. am. obsessed. with the XL riso print I got from Wenting (you can't miss it in the haul pic). We had a great time chatting about her experience at CAKE and comics she had acquired during her time tabling. I can't wait to hang this puppy up in my studio room for eternal inspiration!
+ [Jessi Zabarsky](https://cargocollective.com/hugbox/Main) - So I had a fangirl moment at CZF and this was another at CAKE, haha. I have raved about Jessi's comic, [*Witchlight*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609274/witchlight-by-jessi-zabarsky/) to Dana before. The lineart is so gorgeous and truly its an inspirational comic I go back to sometimes. TURNS OUT, Jessi lives in a neighborhood just north of me and I had no idea!? Hopefully I wasn't too scary, but I'm so excited to have met her and gushed about her work to her face. 
+ [Bianca Brandolino](http://biancabrandolino.com/) - I had seen Bianca the weekend before at CZF, and roughly a year ago at a PerZine Fest here in Chicago. I adore their work, which really shows the artists' hand, and couldn't stop thinking about their Hotties on Potties holographic stickers (I'm classy, what can I say). Along with some great zines of theirs I already have like *Good Omens*, I am now the proud owner of one of these stickers. I can't wait to see them again at a future fest!
+ [Kelly Phillips](http://www.kellyphillips.net/) - Kelly was the last artist I talked to at the fest and I'm so glad I did! Traveling in all the way from Philidelphia, turns out we share a great love of the iconic Weird Al Yankovic. I was drawn to her display like a magnet thanks to the Weird Al bookmarks, and wound up buying her full autobio comic, *Weird Me: A Story about Growing Up & "Weird Al" Yankovic*. And WHAT a comic it is! It was the first treat from my haul I read and it left me feeling seen and in community with my preteen, Weird-Al-loving self. Whether you are into Al or not, 10/10 highly recommend!
+ This was so tough to narrow down for real. So go look at our IG post to see more folks I tagged in my haul!

This was such a magical experience and everyone I talked to said the same. It is now officially a goal for Dana and I to table at this event - so watch out CAKE 2024, we're coming for you!
