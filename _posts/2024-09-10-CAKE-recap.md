Alex here! I had an amazing time at CAKE in August! It was my first time tabling, but I’m a long-time fan of this gathering of rad comic artists, cartoonists, and illustrators. Along with meeting a number of cool creatives, I also volunteered as a CAKE coordinator this year - so it was particularly special to see the fruits of the outstanding organizers’ and coordinators’ labor!

I didn’t have much time to walk around, but I had the great privilege of seeing <a href="https://www.trungles.com/">Trung Le Nguyen’s</a> panel, Comics & Fairy Tales + get my copy of <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-magic-fish-trung-le-nguyen/14722854?ean=9781984851598&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw3P-2BhAEEiwA3yPhwGWtw07jROXFIMlW4HgTZS398FWufM2HSFpEHLZlRujEEmnZDU-IaBoC6j0QAvD_BwE"><i>Magic Fish</i></a> signed. <i>Magic Fish</i> is my all time favorite comic – so it was SO EXCITING to chat with Trung and hear more about his process. We also traded for some of his beautiful prints, and I picked up some of his mini comics (all amazing).

In the time I did have to take a stroll, I got… 
- A <i>Cactus Kid</i> comic and matching sticker from my kind and fun tablemate, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/perdido_blues">Emmanuel Guerrero</a>
- A Bobby Hill slut sticker (obsessed) + minizine from fellow CAKE volunteer and awesome human, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/saturn2169/">Andrea Pearson</a> of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aquatic_panda_distro/">Aquatic Panda Distro</a>
- The newest <i>Cool Teen Mothman</i> zine + a cool crow skull sticker from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/corruptedgem/">Emily Kardamis</a>
- A fun ‘weapon of choice’ sticker from <a href="https://www.tessenelireid.com/">Tess Eneli Reid</a>
- The lovely <i>Song for Medusa</i> from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gracedesmarais/">Grace Desmarais</a>
- A cute sticker from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alexwillan/">Alex Willan</a> (who was nice enough to drop it off after we bonded about Louisville, haha)

So my haul might be small but it’s MIGHTY GOOD!

It was a hot, whirlwind of a weekend - but I’m so honored I shared space with amazing artists and cool humans for a few days in my home city :) Here’s to another good show in 2025!
