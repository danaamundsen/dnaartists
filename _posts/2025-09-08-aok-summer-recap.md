This summer, I (Alex) had the privilege to take a Comics class at SAIC called ‚Äúcomics summer residency.‚Äù Basically I took 3 weeks off work and cosplayed as a full-time comic artist üòé

This was on the heels of finishing my spring class, Writing for Graphic Novels, with the reigning Queen of Horror at SAIC,  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bethhetland/">Beth Hetland</a> - which was AMAZING. I used this residency to continue that work (without directly working on that story‚Ä¶) My graphic novel script is about a girl who turns into a deer, but I haven‚Äôt decided on the final visual form I want it to take. During this pseudo-residency, I worked on a DIFFERENT story with magical realism and deers to start sorting that out lol.

Cue: *Doe*, a 12-page, hand-drawn horror comic (that eventually will be watercolored). The final comic wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without mentorship from each co-instructor: Beth, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jeremytinder/">Jeremy Tinder</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/__bench_press/">Madeleine Aguilar</a>. All three are INCREDIBLE artists, but more importantly they are incredibly kind people ‚ú® Go follow them immediately!! Each instructor gave me a new perspective or something to chew on as I developed this comic, and it truly wouldn‚Äôt be what it is without each of them.

But the other great part about this residency was a reunion of students from my Writing for Graphic Novels Class. Our ‚ÄúLong-form Divas cohort‚Äù provided support, camaraderie, and creative energy I sorely needed. Everyone should follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/itmegrenbee/">Gren</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/laek621/">Kristen</a>‚Äôs comic shenanigans!! Both of their works are funny, reflective, and sincere - but with completely different vibes. I LOVE IT ALL. I also felt so honored to see the development of other students‚Äô works in the class. I didn‚Äôt know most of them before, but saw VERY cool work that reminded me why I love working with SAIC students so dang much.

TLDR: This class was the best vacation ever with the best humans I could have hoped for!
