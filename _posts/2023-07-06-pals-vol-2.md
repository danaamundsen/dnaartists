Volume 2 of our collaborative zine series *Pals!* has been released! We make *Pals!* with contributions from vendors and atendees as zine fests, who we ask to make a drawing based on a theme. The theme for this issues was animals and we got some amazing submissions. Those of you that submitted your address should be getting your free zines in the mail, and the rest of you can [download the zines and print them yourself for free on our publications page for *Pals!*](https://www.dnaartists.net/publications/pals/#Vol2)
