To celebrate our first year of DnA, Alex and I have created some special items to share with our Pals! We have a super cool t-shirt design featuring Dee and A and their cat and bun avatars in black and white. The t-shirt comes in two options, a standard Gildan cotton version and premium cotton Bella + Canvas version, and sizes S through XXXXL. To go with the shirt there is a holographic BFF sticker drawn by Alex, and a DnA Annual Report mini-zine sharing our milestones from the year. Finally, we are including both of our 2023 Sketchbooks in the release. You can get the whole package for just $45, which is a $5 discount compared to purchasing all the items seperately!
