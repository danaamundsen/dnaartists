To celebrate our first year of DnA, Alex and I have created some special items to share with our Pals! We have a super cool t-shirt design featuring Dee and A and their animal avatars in black and white. The tshirt comes in two options, a standard and premium cotton version. To go with the shirt there is a holographic sticker drawn by Alex. Finally, we are including both of our 2023 Sketchbooks in the release. You can get the whole package for just [insert price here]!

These items will be up for sale on our online shop for preorder on [preorder start date]. The pre-order window closes on [preorder close date], and items will be shipped by [projected shipping date].

The shirts will only be available for pre-order, so if you are interested in ordering one make sure you do it before [preorder end date]. The sketchbooks will be available throughout the year, but this bundle price is one time only!
