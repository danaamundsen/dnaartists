Hey pals! We're going to be tabling at [Halftone ZineFest](https://www.halftonezinefest.org/) in Lexington, KY! The event is being held on May 13th from 11 AM - 5 PM in the 21C Hotel. Alex and I are both very excited to attend this event in our home state of Kentucky.

We have some new zines and fun products in the works for this event that we cannot wait to share with you. Check out [our events page](http://www.dnaartists.net/events/) for all the details and keep an eye on [our instagram account](http://www.instagram.com/dna.artists/) where we will be previewing our new zines and merch.

Can’t wait to see you all there!
