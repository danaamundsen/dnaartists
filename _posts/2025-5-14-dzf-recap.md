Hey pals! Alex here :) I FINALLY made it to Detroit! After being foiled two years in a row, I was able to go to where DnA launched. It was our first, and remains one of our most beloved shows. I was pumped to rep DnA!

I didn't have a lot of time to walk around, but that didn't stop me from meeting new folks and connecting with those I've met at other shows! My tablemate, <a href="https://dikovamargarita.wixsite.com/traeshthetic">Margarita Dikova</a>, was an awesome artist and companion. On my short break, I made sure to grab official <a href="https://ko-fi.com/s/7d8772df56">Detroit Zine Fest swag</a>, and art from a few folks whose Instagram profiles I've creeped on for years waiting to join the show. But even though I didn't make the rounds, the trading was ON FIRE at this show â€“ in a way only zine shows do. It was so fun seeing folks work that way!

But the best part for me (besides meeting so many lovely visitors who were too kind about our work), was the exhibitor after party. It was so refreshing to sit in community with other exhibtiors after a show and share a meal. The DZF organizers did an amazing job cultivating that vibe with tasty food and fun party games to break the ice scattered throughout the venue. 

I can't WAIT for next year, and on the extremely unlikely chance they're reading this: THANK YOU to the organizers and volunteers who make this show a smashing success every year :)
