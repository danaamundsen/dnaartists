Just a quick blog post to announce that we have been accepted into two spring zine fests! DnA will be tabling at [Detroit Zine Fest](https://www.instagram.com/detzinefest/) on April 6, and [Halftone Zine Fest](https://www.halftonezinefest.org/) on May 11.

We will be doing a livestream over on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dna.artists/) before each fest to announce the details and feature any new items that will be releasing at each fest, and you can always check our [events page](https://www.dnaartists.net/events/) to keep up to date with all of our upcoming events.
