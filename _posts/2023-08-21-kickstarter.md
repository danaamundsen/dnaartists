Hey pals! It’s Alex here. If you’re on our Newsletter list you might remember I shared I was working on a comic in the exclusive WIP content - well that comic is complete! Ghost Cake will be part of [Aquatic Panda Distro’s](https://instagram.com/aquatic_panda_distro) *The Revenge of Hallowzine* anthology! How can you get your hands on this book you ask?

The ghost’s speech bubbles read “I used to be a baker / I owned a shop and everything / and I miss cake” with a “Live on Kickstarter” graphic overlaid](/assets/img/post/2023_8_21_Kickstarter.png)
