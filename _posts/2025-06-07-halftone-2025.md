Hello pals! Second fest of 2025 is in the books. I went back down to Lexington for Halftone ZineFest on May 17th. This is DnA's 3rd year at Halftone, it feels like we're kind of becoming veterans of some of these zinefests. New shows are always really exciting, but going back to a show that you've done before is great too. I like seeing some of the same people (artists, organizers, and vendors) and reconnecting. My favorite is picking up something new from an artists I already knw and love, and hearing from guests who have purchased from us before. Community!

This year, Halftone was in the same location but they had slightly more tables. I'm grateful to [Cheyenne](https://www.instagram.com/halftonezinefest/) for continuing to host this event, and all of the volunteers that helped out. There were artists from across the midwest tabling, including Cincinnati based [Robert Zant](https://www.instagram.com/robertzant/), and I was lucky enough to table next to [Melon Press](https://www.instagram.com/melonpressstl/), a risograph press based in St. Louis.

I made a mistake and didn't bring any of my cat zines to this fest, which I was super bummed about. However, I think it left some room on the table for some of our other things to shine. Alex's new bun sticker sheets sold out pretty quickly along with our most recent sketchbook zines, which are typically slower to sell. I'm not sure if it's because we had less at the table so there was more breathing room, or if it was because poeple are getting to know us and are more interested in following our work.

Next up is CAKE in Chicago! Get the details on our event page, and see you there!
