Hello pals! Second fest of 2025 is in the books. I went back down to Lexington for Halftone ZineFest on May 17th. This is DnA's 3rd year at Halftone, it feels like we're kind of becoming veterans of some of these zinefests. New shows are always really exciting, but going back to a show that you've done before is really nice. I like seeing some of the same people (artists, organizers, and vendors) and reconnecting. MMy favorite is picking up something new from an artists I already knew and loved, and hearing from guests who have purchased from us before. Community!

Read on to see how it went!

I didn't have a lot of time to walk around, but that didn't stop me from meeting new folks and connecting with those I've met at other shows! My tablemate, <a href="https://dikovamargarita.wixsite.com/traeshthetic">Margarita Dikova</a>, was an awesome artist and companion. On my short break, I made sure to grab official <a href="https://ko-fi.com/s/7d8772df56">Detroit Zine Fest swag</a>, and art from a few folks whose Instagram profiles I've creeped on for years waiting to join the show. But even though I didn't make the rounds, the trading was ON FIRE at this show â€“ in a way only zine shows do. It was so fun seeing folks work that way!

But the best part for me (besides meeting so many lovely visitors who were too kind about our work), was the exhibitor after party. It was so refreshing to sit in community with other exhibtiors after a show and share a meal. The DZF organizers did an amazing job cultivating that vibe with tasty food and fun party games to break the ice scattered throughout the venue. 

I can't WAIT for next year, and on the extremely unlikely chance they're reading this: THANK YOU to the organizers and volunteers who make this show a smashing success every year :)
