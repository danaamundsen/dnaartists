Dana here to recap [Street Cat Zine Fest](https://streetcatzinefest.org/), which was a delight! DnA was happy to come back to this wonderful zine fest. The volunteers were all very friendly and helpful, and there was a wide range of vendors from poets, to ceramicists, and of course plenty of your garden variety zinesters.

The event had some great artists present, here are some of the artists that I got to talk to, or whose work I particularly enjoyed:

After the show, Brent and I went to the Hopewell Culture National Historical Park and walked around the Hopewell mounds. It was nice to get outside and walk after sitting in the fest hall all day. 

I had a wonderful time! Thanks to Stephanie for organizing, and to all of the volunteers, guests, and vendors for making it a great show!
