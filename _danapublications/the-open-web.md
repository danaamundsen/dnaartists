*What is The Open Web?* is a 16 page saddle stitched informational zine about the Open Web co-authored by Dana and her Dad, Mike Amundsen, who is a well-known web API architect. The zine covers the basics of what the Open Web is, and how to create, publish, and share your work with the Open Web. The zine features collages made with retro photographs and comic screentones to illustrate the text.
