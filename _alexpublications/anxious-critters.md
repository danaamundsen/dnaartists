*Anxious Critters* is Alex's perzine meets infozine meets comic about two critters learning to be roommates - one just happens to be a rabbit while the other is human. If youâ€™ve ever wondered what it takes to adopt a rabbit, you love the catharsis of laughing at anxiety, or you just think bunnies are cuties - this zine is for you!
