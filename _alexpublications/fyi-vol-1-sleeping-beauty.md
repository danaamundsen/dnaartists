*FYI Fairy Tales, Volume 1: Sleeping Beauty* focuses on notable variants of the Sleeping Beauty fairy tale, featuring a sassy plot summary of *Sun, Moon, and Talia* by Giambattista Basile (considered to be the first recorded Sleeping Beauty tale). Use this bite-sized zine to learn more about the origins of this majorly messed up story recorded 325 years before Disneyâ€™s animated film!
