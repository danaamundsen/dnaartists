*FYI Fairy Tales, Volume 2: Goldilocks* focuses on notable variants of the Goldilocks fairy tale, featuring a sassy plot summary of *The Three Bears* by Robert Southey (the first written variant of the tale on record until Elizabeth Mure's book was discovered). Use this bite-sized zine to learn more about the human character's evolution from old lady, to little girl, to Goldilocks!
