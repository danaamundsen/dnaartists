# DnA Artists

DnA is a collaboration between [Dana Amundsen](http://www.danaamundsen.com) and [Alex O’Keefe](https://aokvisualartist.com/), midwest-based zinesters, illustrators, and comic artists. Dana draws girls with swords (and cats), while Alex draws nature goth illustrations (and bunnies). They’ve been drawing together since 2010 no matter how far apart they find themselves.

## About the Project

This website is based on the [minimal theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal). Page is designed by Dana and maintained by both Dana and Alex.

The page is a hub for our collaboration DnA, an independent press and artist collective. We attend zinefests and share our work online through [our website](https://www.dnaartists.net/) and [instagram](http://www.instagram.com/dna.artists/).

After set up, develop locally by running this in your terminal:

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
