Big News! We will be tabling at CAKE, Chicago Alternative Comics Expo August 24th and 25th at the Zhou B Art Center. This event is FREE and open to the public.

> The Chicago Alternative Comics Expo (CAKE) is a weekend-long celebration of independent comics, inspired by Chicago's rich legacy as home to many of underground and alternative comics' most talented artists- past, present, and future. Featuring comics for sale, workshops, exhibitions, panel discussions and more, CAKE is dedicated to fostering community and dialogue amongst independent artists, small presses, publishers and readers.
