We will be tabling at Detroit Zine Fest this year. DnA will be selling zines, prints, and stickers as well as collecting submissions for a collaborative zine on friendship from the atendees. We are excited to be a part of this event and can't wait to meet the other artists and guests.

> The Detroit Zine Fest was founded by Yhasmin & Evie to help highlight and spread the wonderful zine community in Detroit, MI!
