Some words about the event from the host:

> Zinecinnati welcomes zinesters, alt comix creators, poets, self-publishers, and book/paper artists from all over (and beyond) the Cincinnati area. Zinecinnati is a place intended for these creators and artists to meet one another, experience one another's work, promote their work, and share ideas and stories. Zinecinnati does not promote censorship of any kind, however we do encourage a family-friendly event.
