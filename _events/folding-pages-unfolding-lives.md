Join Zine Club Chicago as we each share personal narratives to form a group perzine! Alex will walk participants through the process of creating a small auto-bio work (writing, drawing, collage - anything goes!) She'll gather those stories to create an anthology zine, which everyone on the email list will receive for home printing after the event. A limited number will also be made available at Quimby's first-come, first-serve.
