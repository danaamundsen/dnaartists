Alex is pumped to be a part of the book launch party for Shannon Downey's debut, Let's Move the Needle! 

Shannon (of <a href="https://www.badasscrossstitch.com/">Bad Ass Crossstitch</a>) is throwing a mind-blowing event with amazing artists, performances, food, art-making opportunities, and a raffle! Pay-what-you-can tickets are available in advance or at the door, and all proceeds go to the Chicago Freedom School. 

Alex will be running a zine-making station throughout the event. Here are the deets:

<i>Zine-makers have a long history of DIY activism - and we’ll work together to join that legacy! Stop by the Ink & Insight station to contribute to a community information zine and/or make your own for a shared zine repository. You’ll be walked through a hands-on zine folding tutorial and offered prompts to get your ideas flowing. The following week you’ll be emailed a copy of the community information zine + repository link to share our work! Not feeling crafty? There will be a limited number of free info zines available for anyone who stops by the station during the event + info zines made by DnA you can purchase. </i>

Grab your tickets <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/lets-move-the-needle-book-launch-and-art-party-tickets-1020852857377">here</a> -- be there or be slightly less bad ass!
